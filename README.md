# ayokunle-cv
The html file ayokunle.html in this branch is the one made with HTML and CSS.
I have used CSS in this version of my CV. Yippee!!! I was able to use git bash to push.
I hope you like the way my CV now appears, thanks to CSS. (That is ignoring the colour combo which will get better in due time)

Unfortunately, the second image I attached to the lucid.blog post refused to show. I think it is a glitch from lucid though.

We Move Forward.
