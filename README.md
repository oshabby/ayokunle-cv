# ayokunle-cv
I have now changed the name of the CV html file to index.html in order for it to be launched by github pages.
I had challenges getting the browser to see my CSS file. It was difficult and after many tries, I found out github was not able to find the file I referenced because I used a pc local directory link. I changed to an the link bearing  https://bla-bla-bla It also didn't work. 
When I used the copy path tab on github.com to fetch the link, it worked. The link was just style.css

Before the problem with CSS, I found that github pages was only seeing the readme file. Not sure why initially and was confused. Then I remembered that when publishing, except otherwise stated. the host is always looking for index.html

So, I simply renamed ayokunle.html to become index.html, committed the changes and voila!

Text BELOW is no longer valid. Just kept for reference as to how it all began.

The html file ayokunle.html in this branch is the one made with HTML and CSS.
I have used CSS in this version of my CV. Yippee!!! I was able to use git bash to push.
I hope you like the way my CV now appears, thanks to CSS. (That is ignoring the colour combo which will get better in due time)

Unfortunately, the second image I attached to the lucid.blog post refused to show. I think it is a glitch from lucid though.

We Move Forward.
