# ayokunle-cv
ayokunle2.html is an html file containing my CV.
The first html file is the one made with only HTML.
I have used CSS in this version of my CV and yippee!!! I was able to use git bash to push.
I hope you like the way my CV now appears, thanks to CSS.

Unfortunately, the secon dimage I attached to the lucid.blog post refused to show. I think it is a glitch from lucid though.

We Move Forward.
